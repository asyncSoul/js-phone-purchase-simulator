# Phone Purchase Simulator ðŸ’¸ðŸ“±

A small JavaScript practice project based on the book **"You Donâ€™t Know JS: Up & Going"**.

This repository contains two versions of the phone purchase simulation:

1. **Standard Version**: Uses predefined constants and balance.
2. **Input-Based Version** (for browser): Uses `prompt()` to ask user for their bank balance. You can test it in the browser console.

This simulation calculates how many phones (and accessories) a user can purchase based on:
- Phone/accessory prices
- A mental spending threshold
- The available bank balance
- Tax rate

The script is designed for repetition and function modularity practice.

## ðŸ’¡ Concepts Practiced
- Loops
- Conditionals
- Variables and constants
- Functions (reusability, return values)
- Scope
- Basic formatting and output

## ðŸ“‚ Files
- `purchase-simulator.js`: contains the standard version logic
- `purchase-simulator-input.js`: contains the input-based version logic

## ðŸš€ How to Run
You can run it in Node.js for Standard Version
```bash
node index.js

Or copy the script into the browser console for input-based Version
